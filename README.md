JavaScript and DOM Manipulation
###Background
The company ALIENS-R-REAL needs you to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset provided. The collectioin is too large to searach through manually.  You also need to allow users to filter the table data for specific values. There's a catch though... they only use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on their web pages. 


###Your Task
*Before You Begin
Create a new repository for this project called javascript-challenge for level 1 and a separate repository called javascript-challenge-level-2 for level 2. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.

Clone the javascript-challenge repository to your computer.

Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the Javascript challenge. Create a Resources folder.

Add your html files to this folder as well as your static folder containing your javascript. This will be the main script to run for analysis.

Push the above changes to GitHub.

Ensure each repository has regular commits (i.e. 10+ commits) and a thorough README.md file

##**Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)

Create a basic HTML web page or use the index.html file provided (we recommend building your own custom page!).

Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

Make sure you have a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.
Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

##**Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional)

**Add this to an existing repository called javascript-challenge-level-2 created in step 1 above.

Clone the javascript-challenge-level-2 repository to your computer.

Inside your local git repository, create a Resources folder.

Add your html files to this folder as well as your static folder containing your javascript. This will be the main script to run for analysis.

Push the above changes to GitHub.

Ensure your repository has regular commits (i.e. 10+ commits) and a thorough README.md file

*Complete all of Level 1 criteria.

Using multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

date/time
city
state
country
shape

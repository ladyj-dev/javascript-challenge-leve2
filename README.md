# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background

The company`ALIENS-R-REAL` needs you to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a [dataset we provide](StarterCode/static/js/data.js). Their data collection of UFO sightings is too large to search through manually. You also need to allow their users to filter the table data for specific values. There's a catch though... they only use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on their web pages. 


## Your Task

### Before You Begin

1. Create a two repositories for this project. One called `javascript-challenge` and one called `javascript-challenge-level-2`. **Do not add this homework to an existing repository**.

2. Clone the `javascript-challenge` repository to your computer.

3. Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the Javascript challenge. Create a Resource folder.

4. Add your **html** files to this folder as well as your static folder containing your javascript. This will be the main script to run for analysis.

5. Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.

6. Ensure each repository has regular commits (i.e. 10+ commits) and a thorough README.md file

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)

* Create a basic HTML web page or use the [index.html](StarterCode/index.html) file provided (we recommend building your own custom page!).

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  * Make sure you have a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` at the very least.

* Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.


### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (**Add this to an existing repository called javascript-challenge-level-2 created in step 1 above.)

* Complete all of Level 1 criteria.
* Clone the `javascript-challenge-level-2` repository to your computer. 
* Make copies of your Resource, html, and static folders and add to this repository. 
* Update copied files to reflect the requirements below.

* Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
